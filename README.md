CMPS 375 Group Repo
Group 10 in CMPS 375, at Southeastern Louisiana University, aka Music Junkies, is creating a MIDI feedback controller that is to used to 
manage a DAW, and create music.  Using the Teensy 3.2 microcontroller as the main hardware component, we are hoping to create a workable 
MIDI controller that does what we want, and is impressive to others.  Nothing fancy, as everyone here is pretty new to using hardware based
on software....something like that.
